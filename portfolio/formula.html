                    <p> Olin Electric Motorsports (OEM) builds an electric Formula-style racing vehicle every year to compete at 
                        a Formula SAE competition in June. Our team is composed of ~50 engineers, who are responsible for everything
                        from chassis design and fabrication, to PCB design and electrical harnessing.

                        On the team, I created a <em>Real Time Data Visualization</em> system, and was the <em>Head of Sensing and Modeling</em>. Now,
                        as a senior engineer on the team, I'm working on bringing up a Simulation subteam, responsible for creating lap simulations based 
                        upon tire and track data.

                    <h3> Real Time Data Visualization</h3>   
                    <p> My first project on the team was creating a real time data visualization system that was
                        capable of taking data transmitted from the car and displaying it to our engineers. The codebase
                        uses Python for data cleaning/analysis, <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> for data streaming, 
                        <a href="https://grafana.com/">Graphana</a> for data visualization, and Docker for architecture. One of our 
                        key goals was to use as much open-source plug-and-play software as possible and create as many tools
                        as possible ourselves. We were very conscious of the fact that this would not be the final product for
                        the team, and wanted the flexibility of improving/changing the tools we used where possible. with
                        our codebase, we could stream real data from the car and produce something like the graph to the right.

                    <h3> Head of Sensing and Modeling </h3>
                    <p> As Head of Sensing and Modeling, I was responsible for 7 engineers who are working on integrating various software tools and sensors onto the vehicle 
                        to inform our future design decisions and give us unprecendented information about the way our car drives. Together, we added the following
                        to the car:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> A Kalman-filter used to estimate the real speed of the car
                        <li> CAN integration to the data visualization system
                        <li> A GPS system + circuit. 
                        <li> A sensing controller board and secondary filter boards.
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Aside from sensing and modeling specific responsibilities, the leads on the team made design
                        decisions about the current iteration of our car, including wire harnessing and board placement. We are also responsible for 
                        onboarding the dozen new electrical members that join Formula each year and giving them introductions to 
                        electrical design software, circuit/schematic construction, and software design.
