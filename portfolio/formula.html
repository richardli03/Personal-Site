                    <p> Olin Electric Motorsports (OEM) builds an electric Formula-style racing vehicle every year to compete at 
                        a Formula SAE competition in June. Our team is composed of ~50 engineers, who are responsible for everything
                        from chassis design and fabrication, to PCB design and electrical harnessing.

                    <p> As a pure software engineer, I wasn't sure I'd have a place on the team when I first joined in 2021. However, I 
                        gradually noticed that there were was an opportunity use software as a tool to collect, display, and utilize
                        data to improve our car.
                        I started off working on creating a <em>Real Time Data Visualization</em> system and now 
                        I'm the <em>Head of Sensing and Modeling</em> on the team.

                    <h3> Real Time Data Visualization</h3>   
                    <p> My first project on the team was creating a real time data visualization system that was
                        capable of taking data transmitted from the car and displaying it to our engineers. The codebase
                        uses Python for data cleaning/analysis, <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> for data streaming, 
                        <a href="https://grafana.com/">Graphana</a> for data visualization, and Docker for architecture. One of our 
                        key goals was to use as much open-source plug-and-play software as possible and create as many tools
                        as possible ourselves. We were very conscious of the fact that this would not be the final product for
                        the team, and wanted the flexibility of improving/changing the tools we used where possible. with
                        our codebase, we could stream real data from the car and produce something like the graph to the right.

                    <h3> Head of Sensing and Modeling </h3>
                    <p> When I attended competition last June, one of the deepest insights I got was during the design review. The 
                        judges kept on asking why we chose to make various design decisions, and although we had all of datasheets to
                        back up our viewpoints, we couldn't produce the simulations or data necessary to ensure that we had made the right choice.
                        Having created the data visualization system that was to go on the car next year, I realized that this was a niche that
                        we should be trying hard to fill, and I proposed the creation of a sensing and modeling team. 
                        Now, I'm responsible for 7 engineers who are working on integrating various software tools and sensors onto the vehicle 
                        to inform our future design decisions and 
                        give us unprecendented information about the way our car drives.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Aside from sensing and modeling specific responsibilities, I also work with the other leads on the team to make design
                        decisions about the current iteration of our car, including harnessing and board placement. We are also responsible for 
                        onboarding the nearly 10 new members that join Formula each year and giving them introductions to 
                        electrical design software, circuit/schematic construction, and software design.
