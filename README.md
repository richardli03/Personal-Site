# My personal website
Richard Li

Welcome to my personal website! It's gone through a lot since I first started
making it in 2020 over the pandemic. It was my first foray into programming of
any sort, and I'm proud of the progress it's seen since then. 

This website features a portfolio of my projects, and about me page, a page for
my resume, and a page for music. I'm hoping to use it to express myself in a
more complete way to people who want to get to know me.
